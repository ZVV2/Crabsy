## Restarting project (2025/05/12)

The "Crabsy" project has been elevated from a small experiment of @SamuelNoesslboeck to a Team project to improve the quality of software and especially AI. As a first step, the repo has been moved an split up, with this repo containing only the construction and electronics from now on (everything concerning the hardware).
